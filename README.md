# TCR-nanopore-project-for-CamBioHack2024
Exploring TCR repertoire with long read sequencing

[This paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44137-7) published recently has provided datasets of TCR sequencing utilising R10 nanopore platform.

For the first day of the Hackathon we are just going to replicated their analysis for the AML samples including sequencing data with Illumina and with Nanopore. We will intergrate and compare them afterwards.

Xin will lead the Illumina analysis and Shutong will lead the Nanopore analysis, after which data will be integrated into R by Xin. Teru can choose to join either branch of the project.
